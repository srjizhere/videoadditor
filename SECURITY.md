# 🔒 Security Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines security best practices and configurations for the Video Editor application.

## ✅ Current Security Status

### **FIXED: API Key Exposure**
- ✅ Removed private API keys from frontend-accessible files
- ✅ Updated environment variable naming with proper `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixes
- ✅ Created separate server-side validation functions
- ✅ Added comprehensive environment variable documentation

## 🔐 Environment Variables Security

### **Frontend-Safe Variables (NEXT_PUBLIC_)**
These are exposed to the browser and should only contain non-sensitive data:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_xxx    # ✅ Safe - Public key
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT=https://ik.imagekit.io/xxx  # ✅ Safe - Public endpoint
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION=us-east-1          # ✅ Safe - Public region
```

### **Server-Only Variables (NO PREFIX)**
These are NEVER exposed to the browser:

```bash
IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY=private_xxx          # 🔐 Secret - Server only
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx                     # 🔐 Secret - Server only
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN..."  # 🔐 Secret - Server only
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx                 # 🔐 Secret - Server only
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=xxx                       # 🔐 Secret - Server only
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://xxx                 # 🔐 Secret - Server only
```

## 🛡️ Security Measures Implemented

### **1. API Key Protection**
- All private keys are server-side only
- Frontend components use authenticated API routes
- ImageKit authentication handled via `/api/auth/imagekit-auth`

### **2. Rate Limiting**
- AI service rate limiting implemented
- Upload rate limiting via middleware
- API endpoint rate limiting

### **3. Input Validation**
- File type validation for uploads
- File size limits (100MB max)
- URL validation for image processing

### **4. Authentication**
- NextAuth.js integration
- Session-based authentication
- Protected API routes

## ⚠️ Security Checklist

### **Before Deployment:**
- [ ] Verify `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Ensure no API keys in client-side code
- [ ] Set up proper CORS policies
- [ ] Configure rate limiting
- [ ] Enable HTTPS in production
- [ ] Set strong `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- [ ] Use environment-specific configurations

### **Regular Security Tasks:**
- [ ] Rotate API keys quarterly
- [ ] Monitor API usage for anomalies
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly
- [ ] Audit environment variables

## 🚨 What to Do If Keys Are Compromised

1. **Immediately revoke** the compromised keys from service providers
2. **Generate new keys** and update environment variables
3. **Check access logs** for unauthorized usage
4. **Review billing** for unexpected charges
5. **Update deployment** with new keys

## 📋 Environment Setup

1. Copy `env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Fill in actual values (never commit this file)
3. Verify all services work with new keys
4. Test in development before deploying

## 🔍 Security Monitoring

### **Key Metrics to Monitor:**
- API request volume and patterns
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual file upload activity
- Error rates in AI services
- Database query patterns

### **Alerting Thresholds:**
- API usage > 80% of quota
- Error rate > 5%
- Failed auth attempts > 10/minute
- Large file uploads (>50MB)

## 📞 Security Contact

If you discover a security vulnerability:
1. Do NOT create a public issue
2. Contact the development team directly
3. Provide detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow time for patching before disclosure
